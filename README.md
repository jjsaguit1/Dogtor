# Dogtor Expo App

This project provides a minimal skeleton for an Expo React Native application. It includes an intro screen that displays **"Welcome to Dogtor"** and then navigates to a placeholder login screen.

## Requirements

- Node.js
- Expo CLI (`npm install -g expo-cli`)

Internet access is needed to install dependencies and run the project.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies (requires internet access):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the Expo server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your phone to run the application.

`App.js` defines the navigation flow between the intro screen and the login screen located in `src/screens`.
